# Teltonika-protocol-parser

A lightweight parser for Teltonika AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) data packets, designed to help developers quickly decode GPS, telemetry, and event data from Teltonika trackers.

> [!NOTE]  
> This lib is still under active development and should not be used in production

### ✨ Planned Features

- Parse AVL Data Packets (Codecs 8, 8E, 16, 12)
- Extract GPS data (latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, timestamp)
- Decode IO elements (ignition, battery, sensors, CAN bus, etc.)
- IMEI authentication handling
- Binary-to-JSON conversion for easy use in apps

### 🤝 Contributing

This project is in its infancy. If you’re familiar with Teltonika protocols and would like to help, contributions are welcome!

- Open an issue with ideas or protocol docs
- Share sample data packets
- Suggest feature priorities
